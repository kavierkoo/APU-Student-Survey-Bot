APU Student Survey Bot is scripted by AutoHotKey.

This script is a simple script that allows Asia Pasific Students to fill their Student Survey by pressing F1.
The script will basically loop Tab+Space for 11 time(as there are 11 questions) and Send "Good" for twice for comment sections.

Instructions:
1) Login to moodle > Student Survey > Open up the correct survey form
2) Run the script(if autohotkey installed on your pc) OR Run the compiled exe file
3) Click on the correct survey page > Click F1 > wait till it done > Click Submit (Reason of not automating submit is in case users wish to change something eg comments)
4) Each time the script finished, it will reload,  Click F1 for different surveys OR Click F2 to exit.
